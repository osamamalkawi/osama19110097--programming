- Binary search in pseudocode:
	U= upper bound(array)
	L= lower bound(array)
	Do while L <=  U
		Middle bound = (L+U)/2
		If  target = array( middle bound) then 
			Print (“the number is found with the index of :” + array(middle bound))
			Exit loop

				U= (middle bound -1)
			Else if target > array(middle bound) then
				L= (middle bound +1)
			Else
				Print (“ number not found in array”)

- Linear search in pseudocode:
	For all the items in the array
	Int counter
	Do while counter < array size 
		If  target == array[counter]
Print (“the number is found with the index of :” + array(counter))	
Exit loop
		Else 
			Counter = counter +1
		End if 
	Loop
